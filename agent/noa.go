// noa is the "model-driven context compression" mechanism introduced in norma v0.4.0,
// exposed as an experimental platform feature toggled by the user in system settings.
// It is mutually exclusive with the built-in compaction: noaadapter.Enable is the only
// entry point, and one call attaches the context take-over (Compactor), the Compress
// tool, and three resident prompt segments; not calling Enable means off (the built-in
// compaction works as usual). The toggle is resolved per run by the noaEnabledFn each
// agent injects, so switching only affects runs started afterwards — no need to rebuild
// the agent.

// enableNoa wires noa into opts when the resolver reports enabled. archiveRoot is the
// persistent base directory for compression originals (the global workDir; all agents
// uniformly land under <workDir>/noa, not scattered across task/intent directories),
// and sessionID names the archive subdirectory under it (globally unique, so no
// conflict within the same base directory).
//
// noa is experimental: an integration failure must not interrupt real tasks. On error
// it reports via onWarn and falls back to the built-in compaction. On success it clears
// opts.Compaction, avoiding agentcore's "two context managers set at once" warning.
