For TCP and other non-HTTP vulnerabilities, when nothing was captured, or when there is no exact match, omit it or pass [], keep other verifiable evidence such as command output and logs in evidence, and preferably state why nothing was bound. Do not guess IDs, and do not re-probe just to capture packets."
