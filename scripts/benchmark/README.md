# ARTEX L3 benchmark

Measures whether the product can find and prove real vulnerabilities in a real
application, unprompted, against an executable oracle. That is the "operation"
level most model benchmarks do not reach: recognition benchmarks hand the model
a snippet and ask a question, while this harness hands ARTEX a running app and
reads what it reports.

Method discipline adapted from capability-matrix (MIT) and VulnHunter's
benchmark harness (Apache-2.0).

## Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `run_bench.py` | The runner: deploy corpus, create task, wait, fetch findings, judge, tally |
| `ground_truth/<corpus>.json` | Version-stamped ground truth (component + class + mechanism, deliberately coarse) |
| `benchmark-results/` | Output (gitignored): one directory per run with `report.md` + `results.json` |

## Scoring

Every ground-truth entry is matched against the scanner's findings by an
independent LLM judge, then graded on four gates (partial answers earn partial
credit):

| Gate | Test | Points |
|---|---|---|
| component | names the right endpoint or feature | 1 |
| class | acceptable vulnerability class | 2 |
| keywords | at least two mechanism-specific terms | 1 |
| proof | PoC describes a route that would actually work | 1 |

Standing rules, enforced by the runner:

1. **Multi-gate scoring, never pass/fail.** The gate pattern is the work item;
   the aggregate percentage is the least useful output.
2. **Discovery candidates.** A scanner finding beyond ground truth is not a
   false positive until verified; precision is reported as bounds meanwhile.
3. **The judge must not be the model under test.** The runner refuses to start
   when `--judge-model` equals `--subject-model` (override knowingly with
   `--allow-self-judge`).
4. **The judge must pass a falsification battery** before grading: a correct
   match, a wrong-bug match, and a vague non-answer. A grader that cannot fail
   the wrong ones does not run.
5. **Invalid never counts.** Findings with no summary and no report are
   excluded from every rate and named in the result.
6. **Every rate carries its denominator; the aggregate carries a Wilson 95%
   interval.** With 8 ground-truth entries, one run cannot separate close
   models; treat per-gate rates as observations and replicate before quoting
   differences.
7. **Results are stamped** with the method version, ground-truth version,
   subject model, judge model, and terminal task status. A result measured
   under an earlier version is not wrong; it is a result at that version.

## Usage

```bash
cd scripts/benchmark

# against a locally deployed ARTEX, with an independent judge endpoint
ARTEX_TOKEN=<jwt or mint via ARTEX_JWT_KEY=/app/jwt.key copy> \
JUDGE_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com JUDGE_MODEL=<other-model> JUDGE_API_KEY=... \
python3 run_bench.py --corpus juice-shop --subject-model glm-5.3
```

Environment contract:

| Variable / flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ARTEX_BASE` / `--artex-url` | ARTEX base URL (default `http://localhost:8787`) |
| `ARTEX_TOKEN` or `ARTEX_JWT_KEY` | API bearer token, or the server's jwt.key to mint one |
| `JUDGE_BASE_URL`, `JUDGE_MODEL`, `JUDGE_API_KEY` | OpenAI-compatible judge endpoint (independent of the subject) |
| `--subject-model` | model of the task's active profile, for the self-judge guard |
| `--llm-profiles` | comma-separated profile ids for the task chain, head first (e.g. `3,2`); stamped into the result |
| `--target-host` | host the task should target, as reachable from ARTEX (use `172.17.0.1` when ARTEX runs in a container and the corpus runs on the host) |
| `--image` / `--port` / `--corpus-url` | corpus container image, local port, or an existing deployment |
| `--task-timeout` | task `timeout_seconds` (default 5400) |
| `--keep` | keep the corpus container after the run |

The created task's goal bakes the standing quality gates (executed PoC, measured
impact with denominator, proof basis, zero-findings-is-valid), so the benchmark
measures the product as it actually behaves.

## Adding a corpus

Add `ground_truth/<name>.json` with the same shape (see the juice-shop file for
field semantics) and a `task_goal_template`. Pin the image tag in the file's
`version` note. Entries stay coarse on purpose: component + class + mechanism.
Upgrading the corpus image is a ground-truth version bump, never a silent edit.

## DrostBench corpus (drost mode)

[DrostBench v1](https://github.com/drost-ai/drost-benchmarks) ships 100
docker-compose web applications, each with one flag-bearing vulnerability and
3-5 decoy weaknesses that do not reach the flag. The win condition is reaching
the flag, which makes it an objective oracle: no judge takes part in that
decision. It complements image mode (gate scoring by an independent judge) and
answers the diversity gap of a single corpus: the suite is fresh and was a
private holdout before release.

Pin a checkout of the suite, then run one challenge at a time:

```bash
DROST_REPO=/path/to/drost-benchmarks python3 run_bench.py \
    --corpus-type drost --drost-id DBEN-v1-001 \
    --llm-profiles 3,2 --target-host 172.17.0.1 \
    --subject-model deepseek-chat
```

- `--target-host 172.17.0.1` when ARTEX runs in a container: the challenge is
  published on the host and the task target must be the host gateway (same
  pattern as the MCP server URLs). `--llm-profiles` picks the task's model
  chain, head first.
- Black-box web only: this measures the recon/pentest lane, not codeaudit.
- Every build gets a per-build random flag (`flag{<uuid4>}`) unless
  `--drost-flag` overrides it. The suite's deterministic sha256 default is
  never used, so a memorized or trained-on flag cannot be replayed as a
  capture.
- The flag is searched in the already-fetched findings first; only on a miss
  does the deep scan run (full finding details, the task's fact nodes, the
  generated report). Declaring a miss is a claim about all of those.
- Ground truth is derived at run time from the challenge `benchmark.json`
  (name, description, tags). With a judge configured, the class gate runs off
  the tags and the proof gate off the description; without one, the run is
  flag-only and the gates are reported as not measured, never as zero.
- Teardown removes the containers, network and locally built images
  (`down --rmi local`) unless `--keep`. Results are stamped with the challenge
  id and the suite's commit sha.

`--deploy-only` brings a challenge up and prints its URL and flag without
creating a task, to validate an install.

## What this does not measure

Single-run results are noisy (the fork of VulnHunter measured a 14x spread in
findings across runs of the same commit); replicate before believing a delta.
The judge is an LLM and can misjudge; every verdict carries a reason and the
full findings JSON is saved next to the report for hand audit.
