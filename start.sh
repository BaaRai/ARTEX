# ARTEX supervisor start script (Linux / macOS / Docker ENTRYPOINT)
#
# Usage:
#   ./start.sh                       run in the foreground (Ctrl-C to stop)
#   nohup ./start.sh >artex.log 2>&1 &   run persistently in the background
#   ./start.sh -addr :9000           extra arguments are passed through to artex as-is
#
# It does exactly one thing: run artex and, once the process exits, decide by exit code whether to relaunch it.
#
#   0      user stopped normally  -> exit the loop
#   other  crash               -> rerun after backoff (1→2→4... up to 60 seconds)
