//
// A previous version, in order to make rate_per_min apply to digests, passed the
// per-tick request budget (notifyMaxSendsPerChannelPerTick, derived backwards
// from the lease) directly as the batch size. The consequence was that a channel
// with rate_per_min=20 only refilled 1 token in a 3-second tick, so every digest
// message carried just 1 vulnerability — the digest degenerated into "realtime
// delivery with digest wording", readers received a stream of "1 new vulnerability
// in the last 30 minutes", and db.MaxDigestBatchSize was never reachable.
//
// This symptom is hard to catch in end-to-end tests (existing cases all pass a
