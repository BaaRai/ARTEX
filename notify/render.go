// 3 bytes. Slicing by raw bytes can split a character in two, producing invalid
// UTF-8 — the platform either rejects the whole message or displays garbled
// squares. The approach here is to back off from the budget position to the
// nearest rune start byte (utf8.RuneStart detects continuation bytes 0b10xxxxxx).

// TruncateHTML truncates an HTML fragment by character count and guarantees no

// then check whether the tail has an unclosed `<`, and if so, back off to before
// it.

// packItemCount computes how many items fit **wholly** within the budget, so

// delivery records are still marked as sent — invisible in the message and
// invisible in the delivery history, and the vulnerabilities are simply gone.

// render renders item idx into its actual text — lengths vary by content and
// cannot be estimated.
